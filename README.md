## Risk Analytics for Loan Applicants

### BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

A bank is a type of financial institution that accepts public deposits and lends money to both 
individuals and corporations. it can be challenging to grant loans to individuals, due to their weak or 
nonexistent credit histories which may increase defaults. 
When a loan application is received, the business must evaluate whether to approve the loan based 
on the applicant's profile. The bank's choice is subject to two different kinds of risks:
- If the borrower is likely to repay the loan, refusing to grant it results in the company losing 
business.
- Otherwise if he is defaulter, then approving the loan may result in a loss of revenue for the 
business.
To examine the patterns found in the data, you must use EDA. By doing this, it will be ensured that 
only those applicants who can repay the loan would be accepted.

### BUSINESS OBJECTIVE

This case study tries to find trends that show whether a client is having trouble making their 
payments, which may be used to decide whether to grant the loan, reduce its size, charge riskier 
applicants a higher interest rate, etc. By doing this, it will be ensured that only borrowers who can 
repay the loan will be accepted.

The objective of this case study is to identify such applications using EDA. You have to use EDA to 
analyze the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the 
loan are not rejected.

In other words, the organization seeks to understand the characteristics that are reliable predictors 
of loan default, also known as the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default. This 
information can be used by the business in portfolio management and risk analysis.
